Question No:3

I understand that this is a page for requesting new Electrical connection with BEST. While the page
does what it needs to , the following improvements can be Made:
1) From an Usability perspective, the page can be broken into multiple sections and can be allowed to save after each 
(Example Applicant Details in Page 1, Save and proceed to Address Info and so on)

2) While field level validations are done, it would be great to have suggestions / Tooltip for each Attribute
(For example, Mobile Number box can suggest it should be a 10 digit numeric only, Nearby service number format can be given as example)

3)The Separate Help document is provided through a link, but it can be combined with the Data entry and be shown 
during data entry (On Hover, or as tool tip)

4) The Mobile number validation through OTP can be done in the Top Contact section itself, instead of being done at the end
5) Load calculator can be simplified by suggesting Loads (Medium, Light, Heavy  with some default values, instead of a detailed calculator)
6) UX/UI feels very old with basic HTML. Needs a fresh UX design to make it look contemporary/modern
7) Should have suggestive data entry wherever possible (Dropdown has many values , and should be filtered based on user text entry)
8) Page is laid out very badly with a lot of space wasted (After the data entry, the right side is fully wasted)
9) It would be easier if the Mandatory indicator (*) is near the Data entry side (Near the Text field), rather than on the Label side (on left)
10) Doesnt specify the specs/limit for Photos and Docs, so the user will get issues while trying to upload documents larger than what the
server can accept
